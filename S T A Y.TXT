The story is written with a mix of poetry music and prose. A man leaves work and these people who look like they come from an old 80s commercial try to stop him, but he keeps on saying that he has something to do and he has to get it done. When he gets back home there's a sense of emptiness and he always forgets what he has to do. 

The woman says things such as:
You aren't your memories 
Those aren't your memories 
oh, why don't you stay
Why don't you stay 
Just stay 

In a very dreamlike comforting tone. At first the man just tries to brush them away but as they keep on appearing he gets irritated, saying I don't want what you're trying to sell me. He keeps on trying to search for what he needs to do and becomes more afraid as he loses memory. These commercial dream like phases are written using recurring motifs like in a poem or song in a hypnotic trance; as the man is pulled more and more into them, the manner in which he narrates what he experiences also becomes more poetic / lyrical. 

These people do not react like normal people, they react very strangely- always smiling, even when being yelled at. When he attacks some of them, they turn into mannequins. Although they offer comfort, it is an empty comfort because you know that is not Eternal comfort, as a commercial is short and will end. This fear of the short and finite makes them terrifying, like a poisonous moths luring in with pretty colors. And yet in the end the man realizes that it is his own overthinking imagination that scares him, and instead of searching for meaning about how is current experiences represent his memories, he decides to enjoy the Aesthetics and stays. 

The summary of the story is there in like a commercial where at the end the slogan is given: Only Aesthetics; Only Vaporwave. The title is called S T A Y. The word stay becomes ominous and eventually the man fears the woman saying it, always trying to interrupt her before she can say it.
