thanos inf war: "once the people see how great it is to keep the population under control, they wouldn't need another snap. because they would do it themselves."
"but in order to show something like this now [as the ppl won't believe it till they tried it forcefully], a great power is required. and only the stones can give that to me."

this makes him seem mad (that ppl would believe it and would engage in sacrifice) rather than stupid (about basic population growth restoration over time)
